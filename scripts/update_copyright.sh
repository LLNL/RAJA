#=============================================================================
# Change the copyright date in all files that contain the text
# "This file is part of RAJA". We restrict to this subset of files
# since we do not want to modify files we do not own (e.g., other repos
# included as submodules). Note that this file and *.git files are omitted
# as well.
#
# IMPORTANT: Since this file is not modified (it is running the shell 
# script commands), you must EDIT THE COPYRIGHT DATES ABOVE MANUALLY.
#
# Edit the 'find' command below to change the set of files that will be
# modified.
#
# Change the 'sed' command below to change the content that is changed
# in each file and what it is changed to.
#
#=============================================================================
#
# If you need to modify this script, you may want to run each of these 
# commands individual from the command line to make sure things are doing 
# what you think they should be doing. This is why they are seperated into 
# steps here.
# 
#=============================================================================

#=============================================================================
# First find all the files we want to modify
#=============================================================================
find . -type f ! -name \*.git\*  ! -name \*update_copyright\* -exec grep -l "This file is part of RAJA" {} \; > files2change

#=============================================================================
# Replace the old copyright dates with new dates
#=============================================================================

    cp $i $i.sed.bak
    sed "s/Copyright (c) 2016-19/Copyright (c) 2016-20/" $i.sed.bak > $i

#=============================================================================
# Remove temporary files created in the process
