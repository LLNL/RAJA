RAJA 
################

RAJA is a software library of C++ abstractions, developed at Lawrence Livermore
National Laboratory (LLNL), that enable architecture and programming model
portability for high performance computing (HPC) applications. RAJA has two
main goals:

#. To enable application portability with manageable disruption to existing algorithms and programming styles.
#. To achieve performance comparable to using common programming models (e.g., OpenMP, CUDA, etc.) directly.

RAJA targets portable, parallel loop execution by providing building blocks
that extend the generally-accepted *parallel for* idiom.

=============================
Background and Motivation
=============================

Many HPC applications must achieve high performance across a diverse
range of computer architectures including: Mac and Windows laptops,
parallel clusters of multicore commodity processors, and large-scale 
supercomputers with advanced heterogeneous node architectures that combine 
cutting edge CPU and accelerator (e.g., GPU) processors. Exposing fine-grained 
parallelism in a portable, high performance manner on varied and 
potentially disruptive architectures presents significant challenges to 
developers of large-scale HPC applications. This is especially true at US 
Department of Energy (DOE) laboratories where, for decades, large investments 
have been made in highly-scalable MPI-only applications that have been in 
service over multiple platform generations. Often, maintaining developer and 
user productivity requires the ability to build single-source application 
source code bases that can be readily ported to new architectures. RAJA is 
one C++ abstraction layer that helps address this performance portability 
challenge.

RAJA provides portable abstractions for simple and complex loops -- as well 
reductions, scans, atomic operations, sorts, data layouts, views, and loop 
iteration spaces, as well as compile-time loop transformations. Features
are continually growing as new use cases arise due to expanding user adoption.

RAJA uses standard C++17 -- C++ is the programming language model of choice
for many HPC applications. RAJA requirements and design are rooted in a 
decades of developer experience working on production mesh-based 
multiphysics applications. An important RAJA requirement is that
application developers can specialize RAJA concepts for different code
implementation patterns and C++ usage, since data structures and algorithms
vary widely across applications.

RAJA helps developers insulate application loop kernels from underlying 
architecture and programming model-specific implementation details. Loop 
bodies and loop execution are decoupled using C++ lambda expressions 
(loop bodies) and C++ templates (loop execution methods). This approach 
promotes the perspective that application developers should focus on tuning 
loop patterns rather than individual loops as much as possible. RAJA makes it 
relatively straightforward to parameterize an application using execution 
policy types so that it can be compiled in a specific configuration suitable 
to a given architecture.

RAJA support for various execution back-ends is the result of collaborative
development between the RAJA team and academic and industrial partners.
Currently available back-ends support the following execution modes: 

 * sequential CPU (one can argue that you don't need RAJA for this, but it's useful for development, testing, and portability since developers typically use RAJA to insert parallelism into existing serial code. 
 * `SIMD <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SIMD>`_ CPU vectorization
 * `OpenMP <https://www.openmp.org>`_ parallel CPU multithreading
 * `Threading Building Blocks (TBB) <https://github.com/oneapi-src/oneTBB>`_ parallel CPU multithreading
 * `CUDA <https://developer.nvidia.com/about-cuda>`_ NVIDIA GPU execution
 * `HIP <https://github.com/ROCm-Developer-Tools/HIP>`_ AMD GPU execution
 * `OpenMP <https://www.openmp.org>`_ target offload
 * `SYCL <https://www.khronos.org/sycl/>`_ cross-platform abstraction layer for heterogeneous processors

Sequential, OpenMP CPU multithreading, CUDA, and HIP execution are supported 
for all RAJA features and are considered the most mature at this point.
Those back-ends are used in a wide variety of production applications. 

SIMD, TBB, OpenMP target offload back-ends do not support all RAJA features and 
should be considered experimental. 

We recently released abstractions to support the insertion of SIMD and SIMT 
pragmas in application code to target special hardware features on CPU and GPU 
systems. These capabilities are experimental and under development.

SYCL back-end supported is expanding and expected to support all RAJA features
in the near future.
