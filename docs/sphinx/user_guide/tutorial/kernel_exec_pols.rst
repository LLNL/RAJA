``RAJA::kernel`` Execution Policies
-----------------------------------------------------------

This section contains an exercise file 
``RAJA/exercises/kernelintro-execpols.cpp`` for you to work through if you 
wish to get some practice with RAJA. The file 
``RAJA/exercises/kernelintro-execpols_solution.cpp`` contains
complete working code for the examples discussed in this section. You can use
the solution file to check your work and for guidance if you get stuck. To build
the exercises execute ``make kernelintro-execpols`` and 
``make kernelintro-execpols_solution`` from the build directory.

Key RAJA features shown in this section are:

  * ``RAJA::kernel`` kernel execution template and execution policies 

The examples in this section illustrate various execution policies for
``RAJA::kernel``. The goal is for you to gain an understanding of how
execution policies are constructed and used to perform various nested
loop execution patterns. All examples use the same simple kernel, which
is a three-level loop nest to initialize the entries in an array. 
The C++ lambda expression representing the kernel inner loop body is identical 
for all kernel variants described here, whether we are executing the kernel 
on a CPU sequentially or in parallel with OpenMP, or in parallel on a GPU 
(CUDA or HIP). The kernels perform the same operations as the examples in the
:ref:`tut-launchexecpols-label` tutorial section, which uses 
``RAJA::expt::launch``. By comparing the two sets of examples, you will gain 
an understanding of the differences between the ``RAJA::kernel`` and the 
``RAJA::expt::launch`` interfaces.

We begin by defining some constants used throughout the examples and 
allocating two arrays:

.. literalinclude:: ../../../../exercises/kernelintro-execpols_solution.cpp
   :start-after: _init_define_start
   :end-before: _init_define_end
   :language: C++

Note that we use the 'memory manager' routines contained in the exercise
directory to simplify the allocation process. In particular, CUDA unified 
memory is used when CUDA is enabled to simplify accessing the data on the
host or device.

Next, we execute a C-style nested for-loop version of the kernel to initialize
the entries in the 'reference' array that we will use to compare the results
of other variants for correctness:

.. literalinclude:: ../../../../exercises/kernelintro-execpols_solution.cpp
   :start-after: _cstyle_tensorinit_seq_start
   :end-before: _cstyle_tensorinit_seq_end
   :language: C++

Note that we manually compute pointer offsets for the (i,j,k) indices. 
To simplify the remaining kernel variants we introduce a ``RAJA::View``
object, which wraps the tensor data pointer and simplifies the multi-dimensional
indexing:

.. literalinclude:: ../../../../exercises/kernelintro-execpols_solution.cpp
   :start-after: _3D_raja_view_start
   :end-before: _3D_raja_view_end
   :language: C++

Here 'aView' is a three-dimensional View with extent 'N' in each
coordinate based on a three-dimensional ``RAJA::Layout`` object where the
array entries will be accessed using indices of type 'int'. Please see 
:ref:`feat-view-label` for more information about the View and Layout types that 
RAJA provides for various indexing patterns and data layouts.

Using the View, the C-style kernel now looks like:

.. literalinclude:: ../../../../exercises/kernelintro-execpols_solution.cpp
   :start-after: _cstyle_tensorinit_view_seq_start
   :end-before: _cstyle_tensorinit_view_seq_end
   :language: C++

Notice how accessing each (i,j,k) entry in the array is more natural,
and less error prone, using the View.

The corresponding RAJA sequential version using ``RAJA::kernel`` is:

.. literalinclude:: ../../../../exercises/kernelintro-execpols_solution.cpp
   :start-after: _raja_tensorinit_seq_start
   :end-before: _raja_tensorinit_seq_end
   :language: C++

This should be familiar to the reader who has read the preceding
:ref:`tut-kernelnestedreorder-label` section of this tutorial.

Suppose we wanted to parallelize the outer 'k' loop using OpenMP multithreading.
A C-style version of this is:

.. literalinclude:: ../../../../exercises/kernelintro-execpols_solution.cpp
   :start-after: _cstyle_tensorinit_omp_outer_start
   :end-before: _cstyle_tensorinit_omp_outer_end
   :language: C++

where we have placed the OpenMP directive ``#pragma omp parallel for`` before
the outer loop of the kernel.

To parallelize all iterations in the entire loop nest, we can apply the OpenMP
``collapse(3)`` clause to map the iterations for all loop levels to OpenMP 
threads:

.. literalinclude:: ../../../../exercises/kernelintro-execpols_solution.cpp
   :start-after: _cstyle_tensorinit_omp_collapse_start
   :end-before: _cstyle_tensorinit_omp_collapse_end
   :language: C++

The corresponding RAJA versions of these two OpenMP variants are,
respectively:

.. literalinclude:: ../../../../exercises/kernelintro-execpols_solution.cpp
   :start-after: _raja_tensorinit_omp_outer_start
   :end-before: _raja_tensorinit_omp_outer_end
   :language: C++

and 

.. literalinclude:: ../../../../exercises/kernelintro-execpols_solution.cpp
   :start-after: _raja_tensorinit_omp_collapse_start
   :end-before: _raja_tensorinit_omp_collapse_end
   :language: C++

The first of these, in which we parallelize the outer 'k' loop, replaces
the ``RAJA::loop_exec`` loop execution policy with the 
``RAJA::omp_parallel_for_exec`` policy, which applies the same OpenMP
directive to the outer loop used in the C-style variant.

The RAJA OpenMP collapse variant introduces the ``RAJA::statement::Collapse``
statement type. We use the ``RAJA::omp_parallel_collapse_exec`` execution
policy type and indicate that we want to collapse all three loop levels
in the second template argument ``RAJA::ArgList<2, 1, 0>``. The integer
values in the list indicate the order of the loops in the collapse operation:
'k' (2) outer, 'j' (1) middle, and 'i' (0) inner. The integers represent
the order of the lambda arguments and the order of the range segments in the
iteration space tuple.

The first RAJA-based kernel for parallel GPU execution using the RAJA CUDA
back-end we introduce is:

.. literalinclude:: ../../../../exercises/kernelintro-execpols_solution.cpp
   :start-after: _raja_tensorinit_cuda_start
   :end-before: _raja_tensorinit_cuda_end
   :language: C++

Here, we use the ``RAJA::statement::CudaKernel`` statement type to
indicate that we want a CUDA kernel to be launched. The 'k', 'j', 'i'
iteration variables are mapped to CUDA threads using the CUDA execution
policy types ``RAJA::cuda_thread_z_loop``, ``RAJA::cuda_thread_y_loop``,
and ``RAJA::cuda_thread_x_loop``, respectively. Thus, we use a 
a three-dimensional CUDA thread-block to map the loop iterations to CUDA
threads. The ``_loop`` part of each execution policy name indicates that
the indexing in the associated portion of the mapping will use a block-stride
loop. This is useful to guarantee that the policy will work for any 
array regardless of size in each coordinate dimension.

To execute the kernel with a prescribed mapping of iterations to a
thread-block using RAJA, we could do the following:

.. literalinclude:: ../../../../exercises/kernelintro-execpols_solution.cpp
   :start-after: _raja_tensorinit_cuda_tiled_direct_start
   :end-before: _raja_tensorinit_cuda_tiled_direct_end
   :language: C++

where we have defined the CUDA thread-block dimensions as:

.. literalinclude:: ../../../../exercises/kernelintro-execpols_solution.cpp
   :start-after: _cuda_blockdim_start
   :end-before: _cuda_blockdim_end
   :language: C++

The ``RAJA::statement::CudaKernelFixed`` statement indicates that we want to 
use a fixed thread-block size of 256. To ensure that we are mapping the kernel 
iterations properly in chunks of 256 threads to each thread-block, we use RAJA 
tiling statements in which we specify the tile size for each dimension/loop 
index so that each tile has dimensions (32, 8, 1). For example, the statement
``RAJA::statement::Tile<1, RAJA::tile_fixed<j_block_sz>`` is used on the 
'j' loop, which has a tile size of 8 associated with that dimension. Note that 
we do not tile the 'k' loop, since the block size is one in that dimension. 

The other main difference with the previous block-stride loop kernel
version is that we map iterations within each tile directly to threads in
a block; for example, using a ``RAJA::cuda_block_y_direct`` policy type
for the 'j' loop. RAJA *direct* policy types eliminate the block-stride looping,
which is not necessary here since we prescribe a block-size of 256 which 
fits within the thread-block size limitation of the CUDA device programming 
model.

For context and comparison, here is the same kernel implementation using
CUDA directly:

.. literalinclude:: ../../../../exercises/kernelintro-execpols_solution.cpp
   :start-after: _cuda_tensorinit_tiled_direct_start
   :end-before: _cuda_tensorinit_tiled_direct_end
   :language: C++

The ``nested_init`` device kernel used here is:

.. literalinclude:: ../../../../exercises/kernelintro-execpols_solution.cpp
   :start-after: _cuda_tensorinit_kernel_start
   :end-before: _cuda_tensorinit_kernel_end
   :language: C++

A few differences between the CUDA and RAJA-CUDA versions are worth noting. 
First, the CUDA version uses the CUDA ``dim3`` construct to express the 
threads-per-block and number of thread-blocks to use: i.e., the 
``nthreads_per_block`` and ``nblocks`` variable definitions. Note that
RAJA provides a macro ``RAJA_DIVIDE_CEILING_INT`` to perform the proper
integer arithmetic to calculate the number of blocks based on the size of the
array and the block size in each dimension. Second, the mapping of thread
identifiers to the (i,j,k) indices is explicit in the device kernel. Third,
an explicit check of the (i,j,k) values is required in the CUDA implementation 
to avoid addressing memory out-of-bounds; i.e., 
``if ( i < N && j < N && k < N )...``. The RAJA kernel variants set similar
definitions internally and **mask out indices that would be out-of-bounds.**
Note that we also inserted additional error checking with ``static_assert``
and ``cudaErrchk``, which is a RAJA macro, for printing CUDA device error
codes, to catch device errors if there are any.

Lastly, we show the RAJA HIP variants of the kernel, which are semantically
identical to the RAJA CUDA variants we just described. First, the RAJA-HIP 
block-stride loop variant:

.. literalinclude:: ../../../../exercises/kernelintro-execpols_solution.cpp
   :start-after: _raja_tensorinit_hip_start
   :end-before: _raja_tensorinit_hip_end
   :language: C++

and then the RAJA-HIP fixed thread-block size, tiled, direct thread mapping 
version:

.. literalinclude:: ../../../../exercises/kernelintro-execpols_solution.cpp
   :start-after: _raja_tensorinit_hip_tiled_direct_start
   :end-before: _raja_tensorinit_hip_tiled_direct_end
   :language: C++

The only differences are that type names are changed to replace 'CUDA' types 
with 'HIP' types to use the RAJA HIP back-end.
