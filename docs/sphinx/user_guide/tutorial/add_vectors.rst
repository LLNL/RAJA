Vector Addition (Basic Loop Execution)
--------------------------------------

Key RAJA features shown in this example:

  * ``RAJA::forall`` loop execution template
  * ``RAJA::RangeSegment`` iteration space construct
  * RAJA execution policies


In the example, we add two vectors 'a' and 'b' of length N and
store the result in vector 'c'. A simple C-style loop that does this is:

.. literalinclude:: ../../../../examples/tut_add-vectors.cpp
   :start-after: _cstyle_vector_add_start
   :end-before: _cstyle_vector_add_end
   :language: C++

RAJA Variants
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The RAJA variants of the vector addition operation illustrate how the 
same kernel can be run with a variety of different programming model
back-ends by simply swapping out the execution policy. This can be done
by defining type aliases in a header file so that execution policy types
can be easily switched, and the code can be compiled to run differently,
without changing the loop kernel code. In the example code, we
make all execution policy types explicit for clarity.

For the RAJA variants, we replace the C-style for-loop with a call to the 
``RAJA::forall`` loop execution template method.
The method takes an iteration space and the vector addition loop body as
a C++ lambda expression. We pass a ``RAJA::RangeSegment`` object, which 
describes a contiguous sequence of integral values [0, N) for the iteration
space (for more information about RAJA loop indexing concepts, 
see :ref:`index-label`). The loop execution template method requires an 
execution policy template type that specifies how the loop is to run
(for more information about RAJA execution policies, see :ref:`policies-label`).

For the RAJA sequential variant, we use the ``RAJA::seq_exec`` execution
policy type:

.. literalinclude:: ../../../../examples/tut_add-vectors.cpp
   :start-after: _rajaseq_vector_add_start
   :end-before: _rajaseq_vector_add_end
   :language: C++ 

The RAJA sequential execution policy enforces strictly sequential execution; 
in particular, no SIMD vectorization instructions or other substantial 
optimizations will be generated by the compiler. To attempt to force the 
compiler to generate SIMD vector instructions, we would use the RAJA SIMD 
execution policy:: 

  RAJA::simd_exec

Alternatively, RAJA provides a *loop execution* policy::

  RAJA::loop_exec

This policy allows the compiler to generate optimizations, such as SIMD if 
compiler heuristics suggest that it is safe to do so and potentially 
beneficial for performance, but the optimizations are not forced.

To run the kernel with OpenMP multithreaded parallelism on a CPU, we use the
``RAJA::omp_parallel_for_exec`` execution policy:

.. literalinclude:: ../../../../examples/tut_add-vectors.cpp
   :start-after: _rajaomp_vector_add_start
   :end-before: _rajaomp_vector_add_end
   :language: C++ 

This will distribute the loop iterations across CPU threads and run the 
loop over threads in parallel.

To run the kernel on a CUDA GPU device, we use the ``RAJA::cuda_exec``
policy:

.. literalinclude:: ../../../../examples/tut_add-vectors.cpp
   :start-after: _rajacuda_vector_add_start
   :end-before: _rajacuda_vector_add_end
   :language: C++ 

Note that the CUDA execution policy type accepts a template argument 
``CUDA_BLOCK_SIZE``, which specifies that each CUDA thread block launched 
to execute the kernel will have the given number threads in the block.

Since the lambda defining the loop body will be passed to a device kernel, 
it must be decorated with the ``__device__`` attribute when it is defined. 
This can be done directly or by using the ``RAJA_DEVICE`` macro.

Similarly, to run the kernel on a GPU using the RAJA HIP back-end, 
we use the ``RAJA::hip_exec`` policy:

.. literalinclude:: ../../../../examples/tut_add-vectors.cpp
   :start-after: _rajahip_vector_add_start
   :end-before: _rajahip_vector_add_end
   :language: C++

The file ``RAJA/examples/tut_add-vectors.cpp`` contains the complete 
working example code.
