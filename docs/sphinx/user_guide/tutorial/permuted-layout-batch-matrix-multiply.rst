Permuted Layout: Batched Matrix-Multiplication
-----------------------------------------------

This section contains an exercise file 
``RAJA/exercises/permuted-layout-batch-matrix-multiply.cpp`` for you to work 
through if you wish to get some practice with RAJA. The file 
``RAJA/exercises/permuted-layout-batch-matrix-multiply_solution.cpp`` contains 
complete working code for the examples discussed in this section. You can use 
the solution file to check your work and for guidance if you get stuck.
To build the exercises execute ``make permuted-layout-batch-matrix-multiply`` 
and ``make permuted-layout-batch-matrix-multiply_solution`` from the build 
directory.

Key RAJA features shown in the following example:

  * ``RAJA::forall`` loop traversal template
  *  RAJA execution policies
  * ``RAJA::View`` multi-dimensional data access
  * ``RAJA::make_permuted_layout`` method to permute data ordering

This example performs a "batched" matrix multiplication operation for a
collection of :math:`3 \times 3` matrices. Each pair of matrices 
:math:`A^{e}` and :math:`B^{e}`, indexed by 'e', is multiplied and the product 
is stored in a matrix :math:`C^{e}`. :math:`A^{e}` matrix entries, for all 
values of e, are stored in an array :math:`A`, all :math:`B^{e}` matrices 
are stored in an array :math:`B`, and all :math:`C^{e}` matrices are stored in 
an array :math:`C`. In the following discussion, the notation 
:math:`A^{e}_{rc}` indicates the row r and column c entry of the 
:math:`3 \times 3` matrix :math:`A^{e}`. 

In the exercise, we use two different data layouts for the arrays :math:`A`, 
:math:`B`, and :math:`C` to represent different storage patterns for the 
:math:`3 \times 3` matrices. Below, we describe these layouts
for two :math:`3 \times 3` matrices. The extension to more than two 
matrices is straightforward as you will see in the exercise code. In the 
exercise code, we time the execution of the batched matrix multiplication 
operation to compare the performance for each layout and execution policy.
These comparisons are not completely conclusive as to which layout is best since
there may be additional performance to be gained by more specific tuning of 
the memory layouts for an architecture and execution back-end. A complete, 
detailed analysis of the performance implications of memory layout and access 
patterns is beyond the scope of the exercise.

In **layout 1**, the entries for each :math:`3 \times 3` matrix are contiguous 
in memory following row major ordering; i.e., the ordering is column index, 
then row index, then matrix index:

.. math::
  A = [A^{0}_{00}, A^{0}_{01}, A^{0}_{02},
       A^{0}_{10}, A^{0}_{11}, A^{0}_{12},
       A^{0}_{20}, A^{0}_{21}, A^{0}_{22},\\
       A^{1}_{00}, A^{1}_{01}, A^{1}_{02},
       A^{1}_{10}, A^{1}_{11}, A^{1}_{12},
       A^{1}_{20}, A^{1}_{21}, A^{1}_{22}]

In **layout 2**, the matrix entries are first ordered by matrix index,
then by column index, and finally by row index:

.. math::
  A = [A^{0}_{00}, A^{1}_{00}, A^{0}_{01},
       A^{1}_{01}, A^{0}_{02}, A^{1}_{02},
       A^{0}_{10}, A^{1}_{10}, A^{0}_{11},\\
       A^{1}_{11}, A^{0}_{12}, A^{1}_{12},
       A^{0}_{20}, A^{1}_{20}, A^{0}_{21},
       A^{1}_{21}, A^{0}_{22}, A^{1}_{22}]

Permuted Layouts
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Next, we show how to construct the two data layouts described above using 
``RAJA::View`` and ``RAJA::Layout`` objects. For more information on these 
RAJA concepts, please see :ref:`feat-view-label`.

The views to access data for layout 1 are constructed as follows:

.. literalinclude:: ../../../../exercises/permuted-layout-batch-matrix-multiply_solution.cpp
   :start-after: _permutedlayout_defviews_start
   :end-before: _permutedlayout_defviews_end
   :language: C++

The first argument to ``RAJA::make_permuted_layout`` is an array
whose entries correspond to the extent of each layout dimension. Here, we have
:math:`N` :math:`N_r \times N_c` matrices. The second argument, the layout
permutation, describes the striding order of the array indices. Note that 
since this case follows the default RAJA ordering convention 
(see :ref:`feat-view-label`), we use the identity permutation '(0,1,2)'. For each 
matrix, the column index (index 2) has unit stride and the row index (index 1) 
has stride :math:`N_c`, the number of columns in each matrix. The matrix index 
(index 0) has stride :math:`N_r \times N_c`, the number of entries in each 
matrix.

The views for layout 2 are constructed similarly, with a different index 
striding order:

.. literalinclude:: ../../../../exercises/permuted-layout-batch-matrix-multiply_solution.cpp
   :start-after: _permutedlayout_permviews_start
   :end-before: _permutedlayout_permviews_end
   :language: C++

Here, the first argument to ``RAJA::make_permuted_layout`` is the same as in
layout 1 since we have the same number of matrices with the same matrix 
dimensions, and we will use the same indexing scheme to access the matrix 
entries. However, the permutation we use is '(1,2,0)'. This makes the matrix 
index (index 0) have unit stride, the column index (index 2) have stride
N, which is the number of matrices, and the row index (index 1) has 
stride :math:`N \times N_c`.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
RAJA Kernel Variants
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The exercise files contain RAJA variants that run the batched matrix 
multiplication kernel with different execution back-ends. As mentioned
earlier, we print out execution timings for each so you can compare the run 
times of the different layouts described above. For example, the sequential 
CPU variant using layout 1 is:

.. literalinclude:: ../../../../exercises/permuted-layout-batch-matrix-multiply_solution.cpp
   :start-after: _permutedlayout_batchedmatmult_loop_start
   :end-before: _permutedlayout_batchedmatmult_loop_end
   :language: C++

The sequential CPU variant using layout 2 is:

.. literalinclude:: ../../../../exercises/permuted-layout-batch-matrix-multiply_solution.cpp
   :start-after: _permutedlayout2_batchedmatmult_loop_start
   :end-before: _permutedlayout2_batchedmatmult_loop_end
   :language: C++

The only differences between these two are the names of the views that appear
in the lambda expression loop body since a different layout is used to create 
view objects for each layout case. To make the algorithm code identical for all 
cases, we could use type aliases for the view and layout types in a header
file similar to how we may abstract the execution policy out of the
algorithm, and compile the code for the case we want to run.

For comparison, here is an OpenMP CPU variant using layout 1:

.. literalinclude:: ../../../../exercises/permuted-layout-batch-matrix-multiply_solution.cpp
   :start-after: _permutedlayout_batchedmatmult_omp_start
   :end-before: _permutedlayout_batchedmatmult_omp_end
   :language: C++

The only difference between this variant and the sequential CPU variant shown
above is the execution policy. The lambda expression loop body is identical
to the sequential CPU variant.

The exercise files also contain variants for RAJA CUDA and HIP back-ends.
Their similarities and differences are the same as what we've just described.
