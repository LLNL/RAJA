RAJA User Guide

If you have some familiarity with RAJA and want to get up and running quickly,
check out :ref:`getting_started-label`. This guide contains information
about accessing the RAJA code, building it, and basic RAJA usage.

If you are completely new to RAJA, please check out the :ref:`tutorial-label`.
It contains a discussion of essential C++ concepts and will walk you
through a sequence of code examples that show how to use key RAJA features.

See :ref:`features-label` for a complete, high-level description of RAJA
features (like a reference guide).

Additional information about things to think about when considering whether
to use RAJA in an application can be found in :ref:`app-considerations-label`.
