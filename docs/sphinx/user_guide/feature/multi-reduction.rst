=========================
MultiReduction Operations
=========================

RAJA provides multi-reduction types that allow users to perform a runtime number
of reduction operations in kernels launched using ``RAJA::forall``, ``RAJA::kernel``,
and ``RAJA::launch`` methods in a portable, thread-safe manner. Users may
use as many multi-reduction objects in a loop kernel as they need. If a small
fixed number of reductions is required in a loop kernel then reductions can be
used. Available RAJA multi-reduction types are described in this section.

.. note:: All RAJA multi-reduction types are located in the namespace ``RAJA``.

Also

.. note:: * Each RAJA multi-reduction type is templated on a **multi-reduction policy**
            and a **reduction value type** for the multi-reduction variable. The
            **multi-reduction policy type must be compatible with the execution
            policy used by the kernel in which it is used.** For example, in
            a CUDA kernel, a CUDA multi-reduction policy must be used.
          * Each RAJA multi-reduction type accepts an **initial reduction value or
            values** at construction (see below).
          * Each RAJA multi-reduction type has a 'get' method to access reduced
            values after kernel execution completes.

Please see the following sections for a description of reducers:

 * :ref:`feat-reductions-label`.

Please see the following cook book sections for guidance on policy usage:

 * :ref:`cook-book-multi-reductions-label`.


--------------------
MultiReduction Types
--------------------

RAJA supports three common multi-reduction types:

* ``MultiReduceSum< multi_reduce_policy, data_type >`` - Sum of values.

* ``MultiReduceMin< multi_reduce_policy, data_type >`` - Min value.

* ``MultiReduceMax< multi_reduce_policy, data_type >`` - Max value.

and two less common bitwise multi-reduction types:

* ``MultiReduceBitAnd< multi_reduce_policy, data_type >`` - Bitwise 'and' of values (i.e., ``a & b``).

* ``MultiReduceBitOr< multi_reduce_policy, data_type >`` - Bitwise 'or' of values (i.e., ``a | b``).

.. note:: ``RAJA::MultiReduceBitAnd`` and ``RAJA::MultiReduceBitOr`` reduction types are designed to work on integral data types because **in C++, at the language level, there is no such thing as a bitwise operator on floating-point numbers.**

-----------------------
MultiReduction Examples
-----------------------

Next, we provide a few examples to illustrate basic usage of RAJA multi-reduction
types.

Here is a simple RAJA multi-reduction example that shows how to use a sum
multi-reduction type::

  const int N = 1000;
  const int B = 10;

  //
  // Initialize an array of length N with all ones, and another array to
  // integers between 0 and B-1
  //
  int vec[N];
  int bins[N];
  for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
    vec[i] = 1;
    bins[i] = i % B;
  }

  // Create a sum multi-reduction object with a size of B, and initial
  // values of zero
  RAJA::MultiReduceSum< RAJA::omp_multi_reduce, int > vsum(B, 0);

  // Run a kernel using the multi-reduction object
  RAJA::forall<RAJA::omp_parallel_for_exec>( RAJA::RangeSegment(0, N),
    [=](RAJA::Index_type i) {

    vsum[bins[i]] += vec[i];

  });

  // After kernel is run, extract the reduced values
  int my_vsums[B];
  for (int bin = 0; bin < B; ++bin) {
    my_vsums[bin] = vsum[bin].get();
  }

The results of these operations will yield the following values:

 * my_vsums[0] == 100
 * my_vsums[1] == 100
 * my_vsums[2] == 100
 * my_vsums[3] == 100
 * my_vsums[4] == 100
 * my_vsums[5] == 100
 * my_vsums[6] == 100
 * my_vsums[7] == 100
 * my_vsums[8] == 100
 * my_vsums[9] == 100


Here is the same example but using values stored in a container::

  const int N = 1000;
  const int B = 10;

  //
  // Initialize an array of length N with all ones, and another array to
  // integers between 0 and B-1
  //
  int vec[N];
  int bins[N];
  for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
    vec[i] = 1;
    bins[i] = i % B;
  }

  // Create a vector with a size of B, and initial values of zero
  std::vector<int> my_vsums(B, 0);

  // Create a multi-reducer initalized with size and values from my_vsums
  RAJA::MultiReduceSum< RAJA::omp_multi_reduce, int > vsum(my_vsums);

  // Run a kernel using the multi-reduction object
  RAJA::forall<RAJA::omp_parallel_for_exec>( RAJA::RangeSegment(0, N),
    [=](RAJA::Index_type i) {

    vsum[bins[i]] += vec[i];

  });

  // After kernel is run, extract the reduced values back into my_vsums
  vsum.get_all(my_vsums);

The results of these operations will yield the following values:

 * my_vsums[0] == 100
 * my_vsums[1] == 100
 * my_vsums[2] == 100
 * my_vsums[3] == 100
 * my_vsums[4] == 100
 * my_vsums[5] == 100
 * my_vsums[6] == 100
 * my_vsums[7] == 100
 * my_vsums[8] == 100
 * my_vsums[9] == 100





Here is an example of a bitwise or multi-reduction::

  const int N = 128;
  const int B = 8;

  //
  // Initialize an array of length N to integers between 0 and B-1
  //
  int bins[N];
  for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
    bins[i] = i % B;
  }

  // Create a bitwise or multi-reduction object with initial value of '0'
  RAJA::MultiReduceBitOr< RAJA::omp_multi_reduce, int > vor(B, 0);

  // Run a kernel using the multi-reduction object
  RAJA::forall<RAJA::omp_parallel_for_exec>( RAJA::RangeSegment(0, N),
    [=](RAJA::Index_type i) {

    vor[bins[i]] |= i;

  });

  // After kernel is run, extract the reduced values
  int my_vors[B];
  for (int bin = 0; bin < B; ++bin) {
    my_vors[bin] = vor[bin].get();
  }

The results of these operations will yield the following values:

 * my_vors[0] == 120 == 0b1111000
 * my_vors[1] == 121 == 0b1111001
 * my_vors[2] == 122 == 0b1111010
 * my_vors[3] == 123 == 0b1111011
 * my_vors[4] == 124 == 0b1111100
 * my_vors[5] == 125 == 0b1111101
 * my_vors[6] == 126 == 0b1111110
 * my_vors[7] == 127 == 0b1111111

The results of the multi-reduction start at 120 and increase to 127. In binary
representation (i.e., bits), :math:`120 = 0b1111000` and :math:`127 = 0b1111111`.
The bins were picked in such a way that all the integers in a bin had the same
remainder modulo 8 so their last 3 binary digits were all the same while their
upper binary digits varied. Because bitwise or keeps all the set bits the upper
bits are all set because at least one integer in that bin set them, but the last
3 bits were the same in all the integers so the last 3 bits are the same as the
remainder modulo 8 of the bin number.
