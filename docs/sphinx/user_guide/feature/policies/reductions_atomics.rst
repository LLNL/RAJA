Reduction Policies
-------------------------

Each RAJA reduction object must be defined with a 'reduction policy'
type. Reduction policy types are distinct from loop execution policy types.
It is important to note the following constraint about RAJA reduction usage:

.. important:: To guarantee correctness, a **reduction policy must support
          the loop execution policy** used. For example, a CUDA
          reduction policy must be used when the execution policy is a
          CUDA policy. However an OpenMP reduction policy or a CUDA reduction
          policy may be used when the execution policy is an OpenMP policy,
          and so on.

.. note:: It is undefined behavior to use a reducer object with a loop execution
          policy that does not match the ``RAJA::Policy`` enum argument used
          most recently to set up the reducer object. ``RAJA::Policy::undefined``
          may be used with any of the loop policies supported by the reduction
          policy. For example, if a reducer object with a CUDA reduction policy
          is setup with ``RAJA::Policy::cuda``, but used in a sequential loop,
          then that is undefined behavior. Using either
          ``RAJA::Policy::undefined`` or ``RAJA::Policy::sequential`` is
          correct.

.. important:: RAJA reductions used with SIMD execution policies are not
          guaranteed to generate correct results. So they should not be used
          for kernels containing reductions.

MultiReduction Policies
-------------------------

Each RAJA multi-reduction object must be defined with a 'multi-reduction policy'
type. Multi-reduction policy types are distinct from loop execution policy types.
It is important to note the following constraints about RAJA multi-reduction usage:

.. important:: To guarantee correctness, a **multi-reduction policy must support
               the loop execution policy** used. For example, a CUDA
               multi-reduction policy must be used when the execution policy is a
               CUDA policy. However an OpenMP multi-reduction policy or a CUDA
               multi-reduction policy may be used when the execution policy is an
               OpenMP policy, and so on.

.. note:: It is undefined behavior to use a multi-reducer object with a loop
          execution policy that does not match the ``RAJA::Policy`` enum
          argument used to most recently setup the multi-reducer object.
          ``RAJA::Policy::undefined`` may be used with any of the loop policies
          supported by the multi-reduction policy. For example, if a
          multi-reducer object with a CUDA multi-reduction policy is setup with
          ``RAJA::Policy::cuda``, but used in a sequential loop, then that is
          undefined behavior. Using either ``RAJA::Policy::undefined`` or
          ``RAJA::Policy::sequential`` is correct.

.. important:: RAJA multi-reductions used with SIMD execution policies are not
          guaranteed to generate correct results. So they should not be used
          for kernels containing multi-reductions.

Atomic Policies
-------------------------

Each RAJA atomic operation must be defined with an 'atomic policy'
type. Atomic policy types are distinct from loop execution policy types.

.. important:: An atomic policy type must be consistent with the loop execution
               policy for the kernel in which the atomic operation is used.

The following table summarizes RAJA atomic policies and usage.

                                            takes a host atomic policy template
                                            argument. See additional explanation

============================= ============= ========================================

.. note:: The ``cuda_atomic_explicit`` and ``hip_atomic_explicit`` policies
          take a host atomic policy template parameter. They are intended to
          be used with kernels that are host-device decorated to be used in
          either a host or device execution context, possibly decided at run time.

Here is an example illustrating use of the ``cuda_atomic_explicit`` policy with an
OpenMP host policy::

  auto kernel = [=] RAJA_HOST_DEVICE (RAJA::Index_type i) {
    RAJA::atomicAdd< RAJA::cuda_atomic_explicit<omp_atomic> >(&sum, 1);
  };

  RAJA::forall< RAJA::cuda_exec<BLOCK_SIZE> >(RAJA::TypedRangeSegment<int> seg(0, N), kernel);

  RAJA::forall< RAJA::omp_parallel_for_exec >(RAJA::TypedRangeSegment<int> seg(0, N), kernel);

In this case, the atomic operation knows when it is compiled for the device
in a CUDA kernel context and the CUDA atomic operation is applied. Similarly
when it is compiled for the host in an OpenMP kernel the omp_atomic policy is
used and the OpenMP version of the atomic operation is applied.

Here is an example illustrating use of the ``auto_atomic`` policy::

  RAJA::forall< RAJA::cuda_exec<BLOCK_SIZE> >(RAJA::TypedRangeSegment<int> seg(0, N),
    [=] RAJA_DEVICE (RAJA::Index_type i) {

    RAJA::atomicAdd< RAJA::auto_atomic >(&sum, 1);

  });

In this case, the atomic operation knows that it is used in a CUDA kernel
context and the CUDA atomic operation is applied. Similarly, if an OpenMP
execution policy was used, the OpenMP version of the atomic operation would
be used.

.. note:: The ``builtin_atomic`` policy may be preferable to the
          ``omp_atomic`` policy in terms of performance.
