**************************
RAJA Build Configurations
**************************

RAJA is tested with a wide range of compilers in a variety of build 
configurations. Automated continuous integration (CI) testing employed by the 
project is described in :ref:`ci-label`. Building and testing manually is
also important for day-to-day development. We maintain two ways to build and 
test configurations in a reproducible manner:

  * **Build scripts.** The RAJA source repository contains a collection of
    simple shell scripts that we use to generate build configurations 
    for a variety of platforms, such as Livermore Computing (LC) systems,
    MacOS, and Linux environments.
    
  * **Generated host-config files.** The RAJA repository includes a 
    mechanism to generate *host-config* files (i.e., CMake cache files) 
    that are identical to those generated by 
    `Spack <https://github.com/spack/spack>`_ for use in our GitLab CI testing.

The configurations specify compiler versions and options, build targets 
(Release, Debug, etc.), RAJA features to enable (OpenMP, CUDA, HIP, etc.), 
and paths to required tool chains, such as CUDA, ROCm, etc.  
We describe them briefly in the following sections.


.. _build_scripts-label:

===================
RAJA Build Scripts
===================

The build scripts mentioned above reside in subdirectories of the 
`RAJA/scripts <https://github.com/LLNL/RAJA/tree/develop/scripts>`_ directory.
These include:

  * ``RAJA/scripts/lc-builds`` for configurations on LC machines
  * ``RAJA/scripts/macos-builds`` for MacOS configurations
  * ``RAJA/scripts/ubuntu-builds``  for other Linux configurations 

To create a RAJA build space using one of the scripts, execute the script
from the top-level RAJA directory, passing required arguments such as compiler
version, target compute architecture for GPU builds, etc.
For example,

.. code-block:: bash

  $ ./scripts/lc-builds/toss3_clang.sh 10.0.1

will create a build space for the clang 10.0.1 compiler on a TOSS3 LC machine. 

.. code-block:: bash

  $ ./scripts/lc-builds/blueos_nvcc_gcc.sh 10.2.89 70 8.3.1

will create a build space for a blueos LC machine using GNU 8.3.1 as the host 
compiler and nvcc 10.2.89 as the GPU device compiler targeting CUDA compute 
architecture 'sm_70'. 

.. note:: Each RAJA build script for an LC machine does the following:

            * Create a build space directory named for the specified build 
              configuration in the top-level RAJA directory
            * Load a CMake module version appropriate for the configuration
            * Invoke CMake with appropriate arguments to create the specified
              build configuration. These arguments typically contain full paths
              to the compiler and any toolchains needed, and a *host-config* 
              file that contains compiler flags.

          Host-config files, also known and *CMake cache files* that are passed
          to CMake are maintained in subdirectories of the 
          `RAJA/host-configs <https://github.com/LLNL/RAJA/tree/develop/host-configs>`_ directory.
          
After running a build script, one then goes into that directory and runs 
'make' to build RAJA and its tests, example codes, etc.  For example,

.. code-block:: bash

  $ ./scripts/lc-builds/blueos_nvcc_gcc.sh 10.2.89 sm_70 8.3.1
  $ cd build_lc_blueos-nvcc10.2.89-70-gcc8.3.1
  $ make -j
  $ make test

.. _spack_host_config-label:

==================================
Spack-Generated Host-Config Files
==================================

As described in :ref:`gitlab_ci_depend-label`, the RAJA repository contains 
two submodules `Uberenv <https://github.com/LLNL/uberenv>`_ and
`RADIUSS Spack Configs <https://github.com/LLNL/radiuss-spack-configs>`_ that 
work together with Spack to generate host-config files. Uberenv and RADIUSS
Spack Configs are projects in the GitHub LLNL organization and contain 
utilities shared and maintained by various LLNL open-source projects. Uberenv 
contains a Python script that is used to drive Spack to generate a 
*host-config* file. The generated file can be passed to CMake using the '-C' 
option to create a build configuration. *Spack specs* defining compiler and 
toolchain configurations, and Spack packages for RAJA and other projects are 
maintained in the RADIUSS Spack Configs project.

Additional information about this process is available in the
`RADIUSS Uberenv Guide <https://radiuss-ci.readthedocs.io/en/latest/uberenv.html#uberenv-guide>`_.

.. important:: The process of generating a host-config file and using it to 
               test a build of RAJA is very useful since the same procedure
               is done in our GitLab CI testing. See :ref:`ci-label` for more 
               information about our GitLab testing process.


Generating a RAJA host-config file
------------------------------------

This section describes the host-config file generation process for RAJA.

Platform configurations
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Compiler configurations for Livermore machines are contained
in sub-directories of the ``RAJA/scripts/radiuss-spack-configs`` submodule
directory:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ ls -c1 ./scripts/radiuss-spack-configs
  toss_4_x86_64_ib_cray
  toss_4_x86_64_ib
  toss_3_x86_64_ib
  packages
  modules.yaml
  darwin
  blueos_3_ppc64le_ib
  config.yaml
  blueos_3_ppc64le_ib_p9
  ...

Each subdirectory named for a system type contains a ``compilers.yaml`` file 
and ``packages.yaml`` file with compiler and toolchain information associated
with the system.

Generating a host-config file
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To generate a host-config file for a desired configuration, run the 
``uberenv.py`` python script from the top-level RAJA directory. 

.. important:: **DO NOT** run the ``uberenv.py`` script, which invokes Spack,
               in your LC home directory. **Running Spack in your home
               directory may cause you to exceed your LC disk space quota.**

For example,

.. code-block:: bash

  $ python3 ./scripts/uberenv/uberenv.py --spec="%gcc@8.1.0"

will generate a basic configuration for building RAJA with the GNU 8.1.0 
compiler, while

.. code-block:: bash

  $ python3 ./scripts/uberenv/uberenv.py --spec="+openmp +tests +desul %clang@10.0.1 cxxflags==--gcc-toolchain=/usr/tce/packages/gcc/gcc-8.3.1 cflags==--gcc-toolchain=/usr/tce/packages/gcc/gcc-8.3.1"

will generate a configuration for building with the clang 10.0.1 compiler using
the GNU 8.3.1 toolchain (for C++ standard library headers, etc.) and with
RAJA OpenMP back-end, tests, and desul atomics enabled.

Running a command like one of these will generate a host-config file in the 
top-level RAJA directory. The name of the file will contain the name of the
machine and OS to which it applies, as well as the compiler and version. For 
example, running the first example command above on the LC machine 
quartz will generate a host-config file named something like this:

.. code-block:: bash

  hc-quartz-toss_3_x86_64_ib-gcc@8.1.0-fjcjwd6ec3uen5rh6msdqujydsj74ubf.cmake

Building RAJA with a generated host-config file
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To build RAJA with a generated host-config file, create a build directory and
run CMake in it by passing a host-config file to CMake using the '-C' option.
Then, run 'make' to build RAJA. To ensure the build was successful, you may
want to run the RAJA tests. For example,

.. code-block:: bash

  $ pwd
  path-to-raja/RAJA
  $ mkdir <build dir name> && cd <build dir name>
  $ cmake -C <path to>/<host-config>.cmake ..
  $ make -j
  $ ctest --output-on-failure -T test

You may also run the RAJA tests with the command

.. code-block:: bash

  $ make test

as an alternative to the 'ctest' command used above.

It is also possible to use the configuration with the RAJA GitLab CI script 
outside of the GitLab environment:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ HOST_CONFIG=<path_to>/<host-config>.cmake ./scripts/gitlab/build_and_test.sh

.. important:: Before adding a new configuration to RAJA GitLab CI, it is
               prudent to manually perform the process of generating the
               corresponding host-config file and testing it by running it
               though our GitLab testing script as described here.


MacOS
^^^^^

In RAJA, the Spack configuration for MacOS contains the default compiler
corresponding to the OS version in the ``compilers.yaml`` file in the 
``RAJA/scripts/radiuss-spack-configs/darwin/`` directory, and a commented 
section to illustrate how to add `CMake` as an external package in the
``packages.yaml`` in the same directory. You may also install CMake 
with `Homebrew <https://brew.sh>`_, for example, and follow the process 
outlined above after it is installed.

.. _docker_local-label:

==================================
Reproducing Docker Builds Locally
==================================

RAJA uses Docker container images that it shares with other LLNL GitHub projects
for Azure and GitHub Actions CI testing (see :ref:`azure_ci-label` for more 
information). We use Azure Pipelines and GitHub Actions for Linux, Windows,
and MacOS builds for build environments and compiler versions that
are not available on LLNL LC machines. 

You can reproduce Azure and GitHub Actions builds locally for testing using
the following steps if you have access to Docker.

  #. Run the command to build a local Docker image::

       $ DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1 docker build --target <compiler>  --no-cache

     Here, ``<compiler>`` is one of the names following ``AS`` in the 
     `RAJA Dockerfile <https://github.com/LLNL/RAJA/blob/develop/Dockerfile>`_. 


  #. To get dropped into a terminal in the Docker image, run the following::
     
       $ docker run -it ghcr.io/llnl/radiuss:<os-image-compiler> /bin/bash

     Here, ``<os-image-compiler>`` is the OS image and compiler image you 
     want (see the aforementioned Dockerfile description).
 
Then, you can build, run tests, edit files, etc. in the Docker image. Note that
the Docker command has a ``-v`` argument that you can use to mount a local 
directory in the image. For example::

    docker -v pwd:/opt/RAJA 

will mount your current local directory as ``/opt/RAJA`` in the image.
