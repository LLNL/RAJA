******************************************************
Continuous Integration (CI) Testing Maintenance Tasks
******************************************************

In :ref:`ci-label`, we described RAJA CI workflows. This section describes 
how to perform common RAJA CI testing maintenance tasks.

.. _gitlab_ci_tasks-label:

=================
GitLab CI Tasks
=================

The tasks in this section apply to GitLab CI testing on Livermore
Computing (LC) platforms.

Changing build and test configurations
----------------------------------------

The build for each test we run is defined by a Spack spec in one of two places,
depending on whether it is *shared* with other projects or it is specific to 
RAJA. The details are described in :ref:`gitlab_ci_pipelines-label`.

Remove a configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To remove a RAJA-specific test configuration, simply delete the entry for it 
in the ``RAJA/.gitlab/<MACHINE>-build-and-test-extra.yml`` file where it is 
defined.

To remove a shared configuration, it must be removed from the appropriate
``<MACHINE>-build-and-test.yml`` file in the 
`RADIUSS Shared CI <https://github.com/LLNL/radiuss-shared-ci>`_ project.
Create a branch there, remove the job entry, and create a pull request.

Add a configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To add a RAJA-specific test configuration, add the entry for it to the 
``RAJA/.gitlab/<MACHINE>-build-and-test-extra.yml`` file, where ``MACHINE``
is the name of the LC platform where it will be run. When adding a 
RAJA-specific test configuration, it is important to note two 
items that must be set properly:

  * the unique **job label**, which identifies it in the machine configuration
    file and also on a web page for a GitLab CI pipeline
  * the build **Spack spec**, which identifies the compiler and version,
    compiler flags, build options, etc.

For example, an entry for a build using the clang 12.0.1 compiler with CUDA 
11.5.0 on the LC lassen machine would be something like this:

.. code-block:: bash

  clang_12_0_1_cuda_11_5_0:
    variables:
      SPEC: " ~shared +openmp +tests +cuda cuda_arch=70 %clang@12.0.1 ^cuda@11.5.0"
    extends: .build_and_test_on_lassen

Here, we enable OpenMP and CUDA, both of which must be enabled to use them, 
and specify the CUDA target architecture 'sm_70'.

To add a shared configuration, it must be added to the appropriate
``<MACHINE>-build-and-test.yml`` file in the 
`RADIUSS Shared CI <https://github.com/LLNL/radiuss-shared-ci>`_ project.
Create a branch there, add the job entry, and create a pull request.

Modifying a configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To change an existing configuration, change the relevant information in the 
configuration, such variant(s) or target compute architecture, in the 
appropriate 
``RAJA/.gitlab/<MACHINE>-build-and-test-extra.yml`` file. Make sure to 
also modify the job label, so it is descriptive of the configuration.

To modify a shared configuration, it must be changed in the appropriate
``<MACHINE>-build-and-test.yml`` file in the 
`RADIUSS Shared CI <https://github.com/LLNL/radiuss-shared-ci>`_ project.
Create a branch there, modify the job entry, and create a pull request.

.. important:: Build spec information used in RAJA GitLab CI pipelines
               must exist in the ``compilers.yaml`` file and/or 
               ``packages.yaml`` file for the appropriate system type in
               the `RADIUSS Spack Configs <https://github.com/LLNL/radiuss-spack-configs>`_ repo.

               If the desired entry is not there, but exists in a newer version 
               of the RADIUSS Spack Configs project, update the RAJA submodule 
               to use the newer version. If the information does not exist in 
               any version of the RADIUSS Spack Configs project, create a 
               branch there, add the needed spec info, and create a pull 
               request. Then, when that PR is merged, update the RAJA submodule
               to the new version.

Changing run parameters
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The parameters for each system/scheduler on which we run GitLab CI for
RAJA, such as job time limits, resource allocations, etc. are defined in the 
``RAJA/.gitlab/custom-jobs-and-variables.yml`` file. This information can
remain as is, for the most part, and should not be changed unless absolutely 
necessary.

Sometimes a particular job will take longer to build and run than the 
default allotted time for jobs on a machine. In this case, the time for the
job can be adjusted in the job entry in the associated 
``RAJA/.gitlab/<MACHINE>-build-and-test-extra.yml`` file.
For example:

.. code-block:: bash

  gcc_8_1_0:
  variables:
    SPEC: " ${PROJECT_RUBY_VARIANTS} %gcc@8.1.0 ${PROJECT_RUBY_DEPS}"
    RUBY_BUILD_AND_TEST_JOB_ALLOC: "--time=60 --nodes=1"
  extends: .build_and_test_on_ruby

This example sets the build and test allocation time to 60 minutes and the
the run resource to one node.

Allowing failures
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Sometimes a shared job configuration is known to fail for RAJA. To allow
the job to fail without the CI check associated with it failing, we can
annotate the job for this. For example:

.. code-block:: bash

  ibm_clang_9_0_0:
    variables:
      SPEC: " ${PROJECT_LASSEN_VARIANTS} %clang@ibm.9.0.0 ${PROJECT_LASSEN_DEPS}"
    extends: .build_and_test_on_lassen
    allow_failure: true

.. important:: When a shared job needs to be modified for RAJA specifically, 
               we call that "overriding": The job label must be kept the same 
               as in the ``<MACHINE>-build-and-test.yml`` file in the 
               `RADIUSS Shared CI <https://github.com/LLNL/radiuss-shared-ci>`_, 
               and the job implementation can be adapted. If you override a
               shared job, please add a comment to describe the change.

=================
Azure CI Tasks
=================

The tasks in this section apply to RAJA Azure Pipelines CI.

Changing Builds/Container Images
---------------------------------------

The builds we run in Azure are defined in the `RAJA/azure-pipelines.yml <https://github.com/LLNL/RAJA/blob/develop/azure-pipelines.yml>`_ file.
  
Linux/Docker
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To update or add a new compiler / job to Azure CI we need to edit both ``azure-pipelines.yml`` and ``Dockerfile``.

If we want to add a new Azure pipeline to build with ``compilerX``, then in ``azure-pipelines.yml`` we can add the job like so::

  -job: Docker
    ...
    strategy:
      matrix:
        ...
        compilerX: 
          docker_target: compilerX

Here, ``compilerX:`` defines the name of a job in Azure. ``docker_target: compilerX`` defines a variable ``docker_target``, which is used to determine what part of the ``Dockerfile`` to run.

In the ``Dockerfile`` we will want to add our section that defines the commands for the ``compilerX`` job.::

  FROM ghcr.io/rse-ops/compilerX-ubuntu-20.04:compilerX-XXX AS compilerX
  ENV GTEST_COLOR=1
  COPY . /home/raja/workspace
  WORKDIR /home/raja/workspace/build
  RUN cmake -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=compilerX ... && \
      make -j 6 &&\
      ctest -T test --output-on-failure

Each of our docker builds is built up on a base image maintained by RSE-Ops, a table of available base containers can be found `here <https://rse-ops.github.io/docker-images/>`_. We are also able to add target names to each build with ``AS ...``. This target name correlates to the ``docker_target: ...`` defined in ``azure-pipelines.yml``.

The base containers are shared across multiple projects and are regularly rebuilt. If bugs are fixed in the base containers the changes will be automatically propagated to all projects using them in their Docker builds.

Check `here <https://rse-ops.github.io/docker-images/>`_ for a list of all currently available RSE-Ops containers. Please see the `RSE-Ops Containers Project <https://github.com/rse-ops/docker-images>`_ on GitHub to get new containers built that aren't yet available.

Windows / MacOS
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We run our Windows / MacOS builds directly on the Azure virtual machine instances. In order to update the Windows / MacOS instance we can change the ``pool`` under ``-job: Windows`` or ``-job: Mac``::
  
  -job: Windows
    ...
    pool:
      vmImage: 'windows-2019'
    ...
  -job: Mac
    ...
    pool:
      vmImage: 'macOS-latest'

Changing Build/Run Parameters
-----------------------------

Linux/Docker
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We can edit the build and run configurations of each docker build, in the ``RUN`` command. Such as adding CMake options or changing the parallel build value of ``make -j N`` for adjusting throughput.

Each base image is built using `spack <https://github.com/spack/spack>`_. For the most part the container environments are set up to run our CMake and build commands out of the box. However, there are a few exceptions where we need to ``spack load`` specific modules into the path.

  * **Clang** requires us to load LLVM for OpenMP runtime libraries.::

      . /opt/spack/share/spack/setup-env.sh && spack load llvm

    **CUDA** for the cuda runtime.::

      . /opt/spack/share/spack/setup-env.sh && spack load cuda

    **HIP** for the hip runtime and llvm-amdgpu runtime libraries.::

      . /opt/spack/share/spack/setup-env.sh && spack load hip llvm-amdgpu

    **SYCL** requires us to run setupvars.sh::

      source /opt/view/setvars.sh 

Windows / MacOS
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Windows and MacOS build / run parameters can be configured directly in ``azure-pipelines.yml``. CMake options can be configured with ``CMAKE_EXTRA_FLAGS`` for each job. The ``-j`` value can also be edited directly in the Azure ``script`` definitions for each job.

The commands executed to configure, build, and test RAJA for each 
pipeline in Azure are located in the `RAJA/Dockerfile <https://github.com/LLNL/RAJA/blob/develop/Dockerfile>`_ file. 
Each pipeline section begins with a line that ends with ``AS ...`` 
where the ellipses in the name of a build-test pipeline. The name label
matches an entry in the Docker test matrix in the 
``RAJA/azure-pipelines.yml`` file mentioned above.


.. _rajaperf_ci_tasks-label:

================================
RAJA Performance Suite CI Tasks
================================

The `RAJA Performance Suite <https://github.com/LLNL/RAJAPerf>`_ project CI
testing processes, directory/file structure, and dependencies are nearly 
identical to that for RAJA, which is described in :ref:`ci-label`. Specifically,

  * The RAJA Performance Suite GitLab CI process is driven by the 
    `RAJAPerf/.gitlab-ci.yml <https://github.com/LLNL/RAJAPerf/blob/develop/.gitlab-ci.yml>`_ file. 
  * The ``<resource>-jobs.yml`` and ``<resource>-templates.yml`` files reside 
    in the 
    `RAJAPerf/.gitlab <https://github.com/LLNL/RAJAPerf/tree/develop/.gitlab>`_ 
    directory.
  * The ``build_and_test.sh`` script resides in the `RAJAPerf/scripts/gitlab <https://github.com/LLNL/RAJAPerf/tree/develop/scripts/gitlab>`_ directory.
  * The `RAJAPerf/Dockerfile <https://github.com/LLNL/RAJAPerf/blob/develop/Dockerfile>`_ drives the Azure testing pipelines.
  
The main difference is that for GitLab CI, is that the Performance Suite uses 
the RAJA submodules for ``uberenv`` and ``radiuss-spack-configs`` located in 
the RAJA submodule to avoid redundant submodules. This is reflected in the
`RAJAPerf/.uberenv_config.json <https://github.com/LLNL/RAJAPerf/blob/develop/.uberenv_config.json>`_ 
file which point at the relevant RAJA submodule locations.

Apart from this minor difference, all CI maintenance and development tasks for
the RAJA Performance Suite follow the guidance in :ref:`ci_tasks-label`.
