RAJA Release Version Naming
****************************

Prior to the RAJA release in March 2022, the RAJA project used the *Semantic
Versioning* scheme for assigning release tag names. At the March 2022 release,
we changed the release naming scheme to use ``YYYY.mm.pp``, for year, month, 
and patch number. So, for example, the March 2022 release is labeled v2022.03.0.The main motivation for the release naming scheme is to do coordinated releases
with the `Umpire <https://github.com/LLNL/Umpire>`_, 
`CHAI <https://github.com/LLNL/CHAI>`_, and 
`camp <https://github.com/LLNL/camp>`_ projects, which are considered parts 
of the **RAJA Portability Suite**. In a coordinated release, all the projects 
will have the same release name. If a project requires a patch release between 
coordinated releases, it will indicate that by incrementing the patch number;
for example, v2022.03.1.

The following sections describe the Semantic Versioning scheme for reference
and posterity.

====================
Semantic Versioning
====================

Semantic versioning is a 
methodology for assigning a version number to a software release in a way that 
conveys specific meaning about code modifications from version to version.
See `Semantic Versioning <http://semver.org>`_ for a more detailed description.

-------------------------------------
Semantic Version Numbers and Meaning
-------------------------------------

Semantic versioning is based on a three part version number `MM.mm.pp`:

  * `MM` is the *major version number*. It is incremented when an incompatible
    API change is made. That is, the API changes in a way that may break code
    using an earlier release of the software with a smaller major version
    number.
  * `mm` is the *minor version number*. It changes when functionality is
    added that is backward compatible, such as when the API grows to support 
    new functionality yet the software will function the same as any
    earlier release of the software with a smaller minor version number
    when used through the intersection of two different APIs. The minor version
    number is always changed when the main branch changes, except possibly when
    the major version is changed; for example going from v1.0.0 to v2.0.0.
  * `pp` is the *patch version number*. It changes when a bug fix is made that
    is backward compatible. That is, such a bug fix is an internal
    implementation change that fixes incorrect behavior. The patch version 
    number is always changed when a hotfix branch is merged into main, or when 
    changes are made to main that only contain bug fixes.

-----------------------------------------------------
What Does a Change in Semantic Version Number Mean?
-----------------------------------------------------

A key consideration in meaning for these three version numbers is that
the software has a public API. Changes to the API or code functionality
are communicated by the way the version number is incremented from release to 
release. Some important conventions followed when using semantic versioning are:

  * Once a version of the software is released, the contents of the release
    **must not change**. If the software is modified, it **must** be released
    with a new version.
  * A major version number of zero (i.e., `0.mm.pp`) is considered initial
    development where anything may change. The API is not considered stable.
  * Version `1.0.0` defines the first stable public API. Version number
    increments beyond this point depend on how the public API changes.
  * When the software is changed so that any API functionality becomes
    deprecated, the minor version number **must** be incremented, unless the
    major version number changes.
  * A pre-release version may be indicated by appending a hyphen and a series
    of dot-separated identifiers after the patch version. For example,
    `1.0.1-alpha`, `1.0.1-alpha.1`, `1.0.2-0.2.5`.
  * Versions are compared using precedence that is calculated by separating
    major, minor, patch, and pre-release identifiers in that order. Major,
    minor, and patch numbers are compared numerically from left to right. For
    example, 1.0.0 < 2.0.0 < 2.1.0 < 2.1.1. When major, minor, and patch
    numbers are equal, a pre-release version number has lower precedence than
    none. For example, 1.0.0-alpha < 1.0.0.

By following these conventions, it is fairly easy to communicate intent of
version changes to users and it should be straightforward for users
to manage dependencies on RAJA.
