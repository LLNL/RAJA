RAJA is a library of C++ software abstractions, primarily developed at
Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), that enables architecture
and programming model portability for HPC applications. RAJA has two main goals:

  * To enable application portability with manageable disruption to existing 
    algorithms and programming styles
  * To achieve performance comparable to using common programming models, 
    such as OpenMP, CUDA, etc. directly.

RAJA offers portable, parallel loop execution by providing building blocks 
that extend the generally-accepted parallel for idiom. RAJA relies on standard 
C++11 features, such as lambda expressions.

RAJA's design is rooted in decades of experience working on 
production mesh-based multiphysics applications. Based on the diversity of
algorithms and software engineering styles used in such applications, RAJA 
is designed to enable application developers to adapt RAJA concepts and 
specialize them for different code implementation patterns and C++ usage.

RAJA shares goals and concepts found in
other C++ portability abstraction approaches, such as
[Kokkos](https://github.com/kokkos/kokkos)
and [Thrust](https://developer.nvidia.com/thrust). 
However, it includes concepts and capabilities that are absent in other models 
that are fundamental to applications we work with.

It is important to note that, although RAJA is used in a diversity of 
production applications, it is very much a work-in-progress. The community 
of researchers and application developers at LLNL that actively contribute to 
it is growing. Versions available as [GitHub releases](https://github.com/LLNL/RAJA/releases) contain mostly well-used and well-tested features. Our core 
interfaces are fairly stable while underlying implementations are being 
refined. Additional features will appear in future releases.

Quick Start
-----------

The RAJA code lives in a GitHub [repository](https://github.com/llnl/raja).
To clone the repo, use the command:

    git clone --recursive https://github.com/llnl/raja.git

Then, you can build RAJA like any other CMake project, provided you have a C++
compiler that supports the C++11 standard. The simplest way to build the code,
using your system default compiler, is to run the following sequence of 
commands in the top-level RAJA directory (in-source builds are not allowed!):

    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ../
    make

More details about RAJA configuration options are located in the 
[User Documentation](http://raja.readthedocs.io/en/main/).

We also maintain a [**RAJA Template Project**](https://github.com/LLNL/RAJA-project-template) that shows how to use RAJA in a CMake project, either as a Git
submodule or as an installed library.

User Documentation
-------------------

The [**RAJA User Guide and Tutorial**](http://raja.readthedocs.io/en/main/) 
is the best place to start learning about RAJA and how to use it.

Related Software
--------------------

The [**RAJA Performance Suite**](https://github.com/LLNL/RAJAPerf) contains
a collection of loop kernels implemented in multiple RAJA and non-RAJA
variants. We use it to monitor and assess RAJA performance on different
platforms using a variety of compilers. Many major compiler vendors use the
Suite to improve their support of abstractions like RAJA. 

The [**RAJA Proxies**](https://github.com/LLNL/RAJAProxies) repository 
contains RAJA versions of several important HPC proxy applications.

[**CHAI**](https://github.com/LLNL/CHAI) provides a managed array abstraction
that works with RAJA to automatically copy data used in RAJA kernels to the
appropriate space for execution. It was developed as a complement to RAJA.

Communicate with Us
-------------------

The most effective way to communicate with the core RAJA development team
is via our mailing list: **raja-dev@llnl.gov** 

You are also welcome to join our [RAJA Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/raja-users).

If you have questions, find a bug, or have ideas about expanding the
functionality or applicability of RAJA and are interested in contributing
to its development, please do not hesitate to contact us. We are very
interested in improving RAJA and exploring new ways to use it.

Contributions
---------------

The RAJA team follows the [GitFlow](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) development model. Folks wishing to contribute to RAJA, should
include their work in a feature branch created from the RAJA `develop` branch.
That branch contains the latest work in RAJA. Then, create a pull request 
with the `develop` branch as the destination. Periodically, we merge the 
develop branch into the `main` branch and tag a new release.
