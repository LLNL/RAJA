RAJA is a collection of C++ software abstractions, being developed at
Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), that enable architecture
portability for HPC applications. The overarching goals of RAJA are to:

  * Make existing (production) applications *portable with minimal disruption*
  * Provide a model for new applications so that they are portable from
    inception.

RAJA uses standard C++11 -- C++ is the predominant programming language in
which many LLNL codes are written. RAJA shares goals and concepts found in
other C++ portability abstraction approaches, such as
[Kokkos](https://github.com/kokkos/kokkos)
and [Thrust](https://developer.nvidia.com/thrust). RAJA is rooted in
a perspective based on substantial experience working on production
mesh-based multiphysics applications at LLNL. It provides constructs that
are absent in other models and which are fundamental in those codes. Also,
another goal of RAJA is enable application developers to adapt RAJA concepts
and specialize them for different code implementation patterns and C++ usage,
since data structures and algorithms vary widely across applications.
