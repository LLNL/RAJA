#
# The subdirectories in this directory contain simple tests of RAJA
# traversal and reduction operations. These codes illustrate basic 
# RAJA usage and are also a good sanity check to make sure that the
# cod is built correctly and works properly.
#
# The subdirectory CPUtests contains two files for testing CPU execution, 
# one for traversals and one for traversals with reductions. The tests 
# use RAJA IndexSets with multiple Range and List Segments. Tests for the
# nested loop RAJA constructs are also included. When RAJA is compiled, 
# all execution policy variants available for the compiler are generated. 
#
# The subdirectory GPUtests contains four files for testing CUDA GPU 
# execution, one for traversals and three for traversals with reductions 
# (min, max, and sum). The tests use raw index ranges and RAJA IndexSets 
# with multiple Range Segments. RAJA must be built with CUDA enabled to
# generate executables for these tests.
#
# NOTE: When running the CUDA tests, we advise you to set the
#       environment variable CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES to zero before running.
#       We are using CUDA Unified Memory and we find that this setting 
#       greatly improves performance.
